# Logs 1.0 GA Scope

This document defines what's in scope for OpenTelemetry Logs 1.0 GA.

## Motivation

Clearly defined scope is important to align all logs contributors and to make
sure we know what target we are working towards. Note that some of the listed
items are already fully or partially implemented but are still listed for
completeness.

## Logs 1.0 GA Todo List

### Specification and SDK

- Write guidelines and specification for logging libraries to support
  OpenTelemetry-compliant logs.

- Implement OpenTelemetry logs SDK for Java that support trace context
  extraction from the current execution context.

- Implement appenders for Log4J using OpenTelemetry SDK that automatically
  includes extracted trace context in the logs and supports exporting via OTLP.

- Implement an example application that shows how to emit correlated traces and
  logs. Use Log4J for logging, together with OpenTelemetry SDK, and export logs
  using OTLP.

- Add Logs support to OTLP specification.

### Collector

- Implement receiver and exporter for OTLP logs in Collector.

- Implement "array" value type for in-memory data structures (it is already part
  of OTLP but is not supported by the Collector yet).

- Implement log exporters in Collector for a few vendor formats from
  participating vendors.

- Implement Fluent Forward protocol receiver to receive logs from
  FluentBit/FluentD.

- Add support for log data type to the following processors: `resource`,
  `batch`, `attributes`, `k8s_tagger`, `resourcedetection`.

- Add end-to-end performance tests for log forwarding (similar to existing trace
  and metric tests) at least for OTLP and Fluent Forward protocols.

- Test operation of Collector together with at least one other logging agent
  (e.g. FluentBit), allowing to read file logs as described here. Publish test
  results (including performance).

- Implement an example that shows how to use OpenTelemetry Collector to collect
  correlated logs, traces and metrics from a distributed microservices
  application (preferably running in a cloud-native control plane like
  Kubernetes)
